[Troubleshooting]
Q: I'm getting a "digital envelope routines::unsupported" error during `yarn install`. How can I fix this?
A: This error is related to OpenSSL. To fix it, you need to set the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable. Here's how:

   1. In Dockerfile:
      Add this line: `ENV NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`

   2. In .github/workflows/main.yml:
      Add this to your run commands: `NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider' yarn`

   3. In your local environment:
      - On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, Git bash):
        `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
      - On Windows command prompt:
        `set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
      - On PowerShell:
        `$env:NODE_OPTIONS = "--openssl-legacy-provider"`

   After setting this option, try running `yarn install` again.
